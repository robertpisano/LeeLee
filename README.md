So I throw this onto a new directory I create in MAMP.

The .htaccess page is an apache code page to redirect all requests to index.php, where the routing will be handled

Composer is used for dependency management: https://getcomposer.org/
essentially instead of having to put require in every file it will require the proper files manually, as well as give you the ability to download any 3rd party frameworks (like slim).

You specify which files you want required and which frameworks you want in the composer.json file

The composer.lock file is automatially generated by Composer so that it doesn't keep redownloading the same files - no need to worry about that.


Slim will be used for routing, currently we don't have that fully in place: http://www.slimframework.com/
